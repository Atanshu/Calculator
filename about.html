                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>I am an aspiring web developer who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different
                        disciplines,
                        people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong
                        technical skills and
                        an academic background in engineering, front end development, and basics of backend.</p>
                    <p>My passion lies in designing beautiful and responsive websites with tailored sections and
                        communicating
                        complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to jump across verticals to deliver
                        high-performing
                        websites.

                    <p>In my graduate studies, I did many extra-curricular activities as well. I was the part of the
                        core team
                        which organized the Shri Akhand Path Sahib in Dehradun. I was also a part of the technical
                        team of our
                        college's technical and cultural fests. I also participated in various webinars, seminars,
                        and
                        competitions.</p>

                    <p>I'm graduating in May 2021 and I'm interested in full-stack web development roles. Please
                        feel free to get
                        in touch with me via email at goelatanshu0106@gmail.com.</p>
